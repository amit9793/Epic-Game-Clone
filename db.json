Its main story focuses on the player's character, the Dragonborn, on their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. Over the course of the game the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. The game continues the open-world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.Skyrim was developed using the Creation Engine, which was rebuilt specifically for the game. The team opted for a unique and more diverse open world than Oblivion's Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, which game director and executive producer Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. Upon release the game received critical acclaim with praise for its character advancement world design visuals and dual-wielding combat and is considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever made. Criticism targeted the melee combat the artificial intelligence of dragons, and the numerous technical issues. The game shipped over seven million copies within the first week of its release and sold 30 million copies on all platforms by 2016 making it one of the best selling video games in history."
